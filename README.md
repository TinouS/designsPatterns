# Design Patterns
Design patterns implemented in Java ! (simple & small examples)

## Creational Patterns:

&#x1F53A;<strong>Singleton</strong> : Ensure a class only has one access, and provide a global point of access to it.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Abstract Factory</strong> : Provide an interface for creating families of related or independent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Prototype</strong> : Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Factory Method</strong> : Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Builder</strong> : Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Structural Patterns:

&#x1F53A;<strong>Bridge</strong> : Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. 

&#x1F53A;<strong>Proxy</strong> : Provide a surrogation or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Composite</strong> : Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.Composite lets clients treat undividual objects and composition of objects uniformly.  

&#x1F53A;<strong>Decorator</strong> : Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.  

&#x1F53A;<strong>Adapter</strong> : Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

&#x1F53A;<strong>Facade</strong> : Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade define a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 

&#x1F53A;<strong>Flyweight</strong> : Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
