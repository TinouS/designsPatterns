# Design Patterns
Design patterns implemented in Java ! 

## Creational Patterns:

* <strong>Singleton</strong> : Ensure a class only has one access, and provide a global point of access to it.

* <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> : Provide an interface for creating families of related or independent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

* <strong>Prototype</strong> : Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

* <strong>Factory Method</strong> : Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

* <strong>Builder</strong> : Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
